<p align="center">REST API, PostgresSQL, express, bcrypt, and Swagger</p>

<h3>WIP</h3>
<p align="center">Lots to do, currently, authentication with postgreSQL, express routes are setup, along with an admin page and checks to verify.</p> 

<h3>TO-DO</h3>
<p align="center">Next steps is to add some security with Helmet, some caching with Redis for user sessions and logging. Then of course the BIG thing, .apkg file uploads and processing, and using that information for some mini-games.</p>
